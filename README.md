### Interfaces from Solidity Smart Contract - CROW

This code is been generated from Smart Contract using the lib [Type Chain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain).

After each update in the smart contract, should generate this file again and replace it here.

Also, make sure is everything ok in the SDK after this change.


## How to use

Install the contract ethers types

with yarn:
```
yarn install @unicrowio/ethers-types
```

with npm:
```
npm install @unicrowio/ethers-types
```

import the interfaces in your code:

sample:

```
import { ERC20__factory, Unicrow__factory } from '@unicrowio/ethers-types'

const provider = await getWeb3Provider()

const providerSigner = provider.getSigner()

const smartContract = Unicrow__factory.connect(
  UNICROW_ADDRESS,
  providerSigner
);

const token = ERC20__factory.connect(tokenAddress, providerSigner);

```


## Interfaces and Types

Currently, we are making available these Typescript interfaces from ERC20 and Unicrow smart contract:

- ERC20.ts
- Unicrow.ts
- UnicrowArbitrator.ts
- UnicrowClaim.ts
- UnicrowDispute.ts
- UnicrowPrimaryTokensList.ts

## How to run

1. `yarn install` install de dependencies
2. `yarn clean` clean the old builds, removing the types folder
3. `yarn build` build new bundle that will generate the new types folder with new bundle files
4. `yarn publish` publish new version (only admins)
